# About The Project

This is the API Code for my tutorial article:
- https://github.com/Createdd/Writing/blob/master/2020/articles/pythonApi.md

It paints a picture for developing a Python API from start to finish and provides help in more difficult areas like the setup with AWS and RapidAPI.

You will find the end result on Rapidapi:

- https://rapidapi.com/Createdd/api/excel-to-other-formats

If you found this article helpful let me know and/or buy the functionality on Rapidapi to show support.

## Built With

- Github (Code hosting),
- Anaconda (Dependency and environment management),
- Jupyter Notebook (code development and documentaion),
- Python (programming language),
- AWS (deployment),
